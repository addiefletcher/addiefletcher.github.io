    "text": "Nebraska volleyball has been one of the most dominant programs in college sports, but what makes this team so consistently elite? Fans see the big swings, the electric atmosphere in Devaney, and the high rankings every year. But underneath all of that, is their impressive defense.\nVolleyball defense isn’t just about digs or blocks, it’s about stopping opponents from scoring efficiently. One of the best ways to measure defensive performance is opponent hitting percentage, which shows how well other teams attack against you. The lower the number, the harder it is for opponents to score. And when you look at Nebraska’s numbers, a pattern emerges. Nebraska doesn’t just win matches, they shut teams down.\nSo it’s worth asking the question…\nIs Nebraska’s dominance driven by their defense?\nLet’s take a look at some data.\nOur first chart compares these top teams side by side, and Nebraska stands out clearly. Their opponent hitting percentage is noticeably lower than everyone else’s. In volleyball terms, that’s the equivalent of holding your opponents to their worst offensive nights….every night.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nhitting &lt;- read_csv(\"hittingbig10 copy.csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- hitting |&gt;\n  filter(\n    shortname == \"Neb\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=hitting, aes(x=reorder(shortname, OppPct), weight= OppPct )) + \n  geom_bar(data=neb, aes(x=reorder(shortname, OppPct), weight= OppPct ), fill=\"red\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Opponent Hitting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Nebraska Allows the Lowest Opponent Hitting Percentage Among B1G Teams\", \n    subtitle=\"Opponent hitting percentage shows how well other teams attack against you. The lower values indicate stronger defense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut defensive strength isn’t just about one statistic. Blocking plays a major role, too. When we chart blocks per set against total wins, Nebraska again sits in a strong position. Teams that block more tend to win more, and Nebraska is among the nation’s best in both categories. Strong blocking disrupts attacking rhythm, forces hitters to adjust, and leads to more free balls and easier points.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nblocks &lt;- read_csv(\"Power 4 blocksperset(Sheet1).csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- blocks |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\ngood &lt;- blocks |&gt; filter(Wins &gt; 19, PerSet &gt; 2.7)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=blocks, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_point(data=good, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=neb, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=good,\n  aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, label= Team), nudge_x = .7) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=neb,\n  aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, label= Team), nudge_y = 3) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Teams Blocks Per Set\", \n    y=\"Teams number of wins so far\", \n    title=\"Do Stronger Blocking Teams Win More?\", \n    subtitle=\"Scatterplot showing the correlation between blocks per set and total wins with Nebraska in red and other good teams in blue.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to see whether this defensive dominance is a trend or a one year spike, our final chart tracks Nebraska’s opponent hitting percentage over multiple seasons. The red line, representing Nebraska, stays consistently low compared to other top programs year after year. This shows that Nebraska’s defensive identity isn’t new or accidental. It’s a sustained, long-term part of the program’s success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nhitting &lt;- read_csv(\"OppHitOvertime copy.csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- hitting |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\npu &lt;- hitting |&gt; filter(Team == \"Purdue (Big Ten)\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=hitting, aes(x=Year, y= OppPct, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=neb, aes(x=Year, y=OppPct), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=pu, aes(x=Year, y=OppPct), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=neb,\n  aes(x= Year, y=OppPct, label= \"Nebraska\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=pu,\n  aes(x= Year, y=OppPct, label= \"Purdue\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Opponent Hitting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Nebraska Consistently Holds Opponents to Low Hitting Percentages\", \n    subtitle=\"Lower opponent hitting percentage over time highlights Nebraska’s defensive strength.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\") +\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, is defense the reason Nebraska is winning this year? The numbers strongly suggest yes. Nebraska doesn’t just out-hit teams, they out-defend them. And as the Huskers continue to recruit elite blockers and back-row players, all signs point to their defensive dominance continuing in the years ahead."
