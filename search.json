    "text": "Nebraska volleyball has been one of the most dominant programs in college sports, but what makes this team so consistently elite? Fans see the big swings, the electric atmosphere in Devaney, and the high rankings every year. But underneath all of that, is their impressive defense.\nVolleyball defense isn’t just about digs or blocks, it’s about stopping opponents from scoring efficiently. One of the best ways to measure defensive performance is opponent hitting percentage, which shows how well other teams attack against you. The lower the number, the harder it is for opponents to score. And when you look at Nebraska’s numbers, a pattern emerges. Nebraska doesn’t just win matches, they shut teams down.\nSo it’s worth asking the question…\nIs Nebraska’s dominance driven by their defense?\nLet’s take a look at some data.\nOur first chart compares these top teams side by side, and Nebraska stands out clearly. Their opponent hitting percentage is noticeably lower than everyone else’s. In volleyball terms, that’s the equivalent of holding your opponents to their worst offensive nights….every night.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nhitting &lt;- read_csv(\"hittingbig10 copy.csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- hitting |&gt;\n  filter(\n    shortname == \"Neb\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=hitting, aes(x=reorder(shortname, OppPct), weight= OppPct )) + \n  geom_bar(data=neb, aes(x=reorder(shortname, OppPct), weight= OppPct ), fill=\"red\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Opponent Hitting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Nebraska Allows the Lowest Opponent Hitting Percentage Among B1G Teams\", \n    subtitle=\"Opponent hitting percentage shows how well other teams attack against you. The lower values indicate stronger defense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut defensive strength isn’t just about one statistic. Blocking plays a major role, too. When we chart blocks per set against total wins, Nebraska again sits in a strong position. Teams that block more tend to win more, and Nebraska is among the nation’s best in both categories. Strong blocking disrupts attacking rhythm, forces hitters to adjust, and leads to more free balls and easier points.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nblocks &lt;- read_csv(\"Power 4 blocksperset(Sheet1).csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- blocks |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\ngood &lt;- blocks |&gt; filter(Wins &gt; 19, PerSet &gt; 2.7)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=blocks, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_point(data=good, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=neb, aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, size= Wins), colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=good,\n  aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, label= Team), nudge_x = .7) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=neb,\n  aes(x= PerSet, y=Wins, label= Team), nudge_y = 3) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Teams Blocks Per Set\", \n    y=\"Teams number of wins so far\", \n    title=\"Do Stronger Blocking Teams Win More?\", \n    subtitle=\"Scatterplot showing the correlation between blocks per set and total wins with Nebraska in red and other good teams in blue.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to see whether this defensive dominance is a trend or a one year spike, our final chart tracks Nebraska’s opponent hitting percentage over multiple seasons. The red line, representing Nebraska, stays consistently low compared to other top programs year after year. This shows that Nebraska’s defensive identity isn’t new or accidental. It’s a sustained, long-term part of the program’s success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nhitting &lt;- read_csv(\"OppHitOvertime copy.csv\")\n\nneb &lt;- hitting |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska (Big Ten)\")\n\npu &lt;- hitting |&gt; filter(Team == \"Purdue (Big Ten)\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=hitting, aes(x=Year, y= OppPct, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=neb, aes(x=Year, y=OppPct), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=pu, aes(x=Year, y=OppPct), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=neb,\n  aes(x= Year, y=OppPct, label= \"Nebraska\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=pu,\n  aes(x= Year, y=OppPct, label= \"Purdue\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Opponent Hitting Percentage\", \n    title=\"Nebraska Consistently Holds Opponents to Low Hitting Percentages\", \n    subtitle=\"Lower opponent hitting percentage over time highlights Nebraska’s defensive strength.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Addie Fletcher\") +\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, is defense the reason Nebraska is winning this year? The numbers strongly suggest yes. Nebraska doesn’t just out-hit teams, they out-defend them. And as the Huskers continue to recruit elite blockers and back-row players, all signs point to their defensive dominance continuing in the years ahead."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For the past two decades, the Heisman Trophy has been defined by quarterbacks who put together some of the most explosive and efficient seasons in college football history. The highlight plays and massive stat lines draw national attention, but deeper trends in the numbers reveal which quarterbacks truly separated themselves from the rest. When total production, accuracy, and consistency are examined together, a clearer picture emerges about who delivered the most complete Heisman season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"heisman qbs copy.csv\")\n\ngood &lt;- qbs |&gt; filter(TotalYards &gt; 4300)\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data=qbs,\n    aes(x=TotalYards, y=Voting, size=TotalYards),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=good,\n    aes(x=TotalYards, y=Voting, size=TotalYards), colour=\"green\",\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name= \"Total Yards\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 4041.062  ) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 2122.125)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=good, \n    aes(x=TotalYards, y=Voting, label=Name)\n  )+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Heisman Vote Share (%)\", \n    y=\"Total Offensive Yards\", \n    title=\"Do Bigger Stats Lead to More Heisman Votes?\", \n    subtitle=\"Do total offensive yards to Heisman vote share make voters vote based on statistical dominance.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterbacks with higher total offensive yards tend to receive stronger Heisman vote support, showing how much statistical dominance influences voter perceptions. In this comparison, certain players are highlighted in green to show those who surpassed 4,300 total yards, a threshold that marks the most productive quarterbacks in the data. Players such as Joe Burrow, Bryce Young, Caleb Williams, and Marcus Mariota produced the rare combination of elite yardage and high vote share, while Burrow stands out far beyond his peers. High production not only shaped individual campaigns but also aligned closely with the strongest Heisman winning seasons of the modern era.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nheisman &lt;- read.csv(\"heisman qbs copy.csv\")\n\nqblong &lt;- heisman |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols= c(Season_Comp_num, Season_Att_Num), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Value\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Type= recode(Type,\n                 \"Season_Comp_num\" = \"Completions\",\n                 \"Season_Att_Num\" = \"Attempts\")\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=qblong, aes(x=reorder(Name, Value), weight= Value, fill= Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Name\", \n    y=\"Comp and Att\", \n    title=\"How Efficient Were Heisman QBs?\", \n    subtitle=\"Quarterback accuracy through passing attempts vs. completions in their Heisman season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency adds another layer to the evaluation. Comparing completions and attempts highlights which quarterbacks controlled games with accuracy rather than relying solely on volume. Joe Burrow, Bryce Young, and Caleb Williams again rise to the top, showing some of the highest completion to attempt ratios of the group. Their passing profiles reflect command, decision-making, and sustained precision traits commonly associated with elite quarterback play.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\ngamebygame &lt;- read_csv(\"heismangamebygame(Sheet2) copy.csv\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept= 69.5, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=gamebygame, aes(x=Week, y=Comp, group=Name))+\n  facet_wrap(~Name)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\", \n    y=\"Completion Percentage\", \n    title=\"How Consistent Are Heisman Quarterbacks Week to Week?\", \n    subtitle=\"Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels as the most consistent, above-average quarterbacks.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Addie Fletcher\"\n    )+\ntheme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency across the season further separates top performers from the pack. Week to week completion percentage shows how reliable each quarterback executed within their offense. Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels display unusually stable performance, maintaining above average accuracy with minimal volatility throughout their seasons. This steadiness contrasts with the more fluctuating patterns shown by other Heisman winners, and it underscores the importance of reliability in defining truly great quarterback play.\nAcross all three dimensions which were, production, efficiency, and consistency only certain quarterbacks repeatedly appear at the top. Joe Burrow’s 2019 season remains one of the most dominant statistical years in college football, marked by unmatched yardage, accuracy, and weekly control. Jayden Daniels’ season demonstrates a blend of explosiveness and steady performance that places him among the most dependable Heisman winners of the era. Together, these trends suggest that Burrow and Daniels delivered two of the strongest and most complete Heisman quarterback seasons of the last 20 years."
